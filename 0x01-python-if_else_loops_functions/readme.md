## Requirements

- All files are created and executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.10)

### Description of files:
0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
1. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
8. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
14. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
15. Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
16. Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

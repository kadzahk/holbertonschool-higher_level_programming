## Requirements

- All files are created and executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.10)

### Description of files:
0. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2. Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
3. Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
4. Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
7. Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
8. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
10. Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
11. Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
12. Create a <code>function def roman_to_int(roman_string):</code> that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
13. Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
14. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
15. Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary
